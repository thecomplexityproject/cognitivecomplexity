# @TheComplexityProject

## What is @TheComplexityProject ?

@TheComplexityProject is a collective open-source project whose aim is to provide a better knowledge on software complexity and maintainability. One of the goals of @TheComplexityProject is to specify, day after day, weights which will reflect better the value of the cognitive complexity in the real world.

Another goal of @TheComplexityProject is to create a database which will store all the statistical data obtained from experimental experiences or by a massive collect of data provided by developers during their daily work. The idea behind this database is to collect enough data to be able to calculate the cognitive complexity with a very high reliability. That means that our first work is to define accurately what is Cognitive Complexity and how to measure it experimentally.

The members of @TheComplexityProject are researchers or developers which are interested in this subject and which contribute to the realisation of the goals of @TheComplexityProject with their own expertise. They may publish articles or scientific results, collaborate to realize some scientific experiments, organize meetings, collect data, etc.

The final goal of @TheComplexityProject is to develop an open-source module which will allow users to audit their code. With this audit, they will be able to be able to refactor their code in the aim to reduce its Cognitive Complexity, and consequently the maintainability of their software. This module will also allow companies to measure the maintainability of the source code produced by development teams.

## Documentation

To be able to give some coherent values, we need at first define accurately the meaning of each word or concept we are using. These definitions must be enough consensual to be able to be used by everyone which wants to compare its experimental results with the other results obtained by the scientific community. When these concepts will be enough consensual, we will be able to collect massive data which will be able to be compared and obtain statistical results with high precision.

The definitions and the results displayed in our [documentation](./documentation/README.md) are only the most consensual at this date and may be modified or detailed later, when more consensual definitions or more precise results will be provided by the different experiences.

## Articles

One of the goals of @TheComplexityProject is to share in the same place the most relevant articles and scientific works about software complexity and maintainability. These articles may be written as part of @TheComplexityProject or not. The targeted audiences may be researchers, developers, project managers or other people interested in @TheComplexityProject's thematics.

You will find here [the scientific articles](./articles/scientific/README.md) and [the vulgarisation articles](./articles/vulgarisation/README.md). 

## The open-source module

The final goal of @TheComplexityProject is to develop an open-source module which will be able to audit any kind of code to analyze its cognitive complexity and its maintainability.

This module already exists and was developed as part of the [@genese](https://github.com/geneseframework) project, which is an open-source project which is a tool suite providing the possibility to developers to increase their development speed and the quality of their code. The @genese module specific to the Cognitive Complexity is [@genese/complexity](https://github.com/geneseframework/complexity).
