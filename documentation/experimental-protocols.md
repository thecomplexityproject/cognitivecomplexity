# Experimental protocols

The [cognitive complexity](cognitive-complexity.md) is something which is defined in the real world. That means at first that we should not try to define metrics relative to the cognitive complexity before to define accurately the cognitive complexity itself. We can define as much metrics as we want, if we don't know exactly what we want to measure, our results will have no sense in the real world.
