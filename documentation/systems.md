## Definitions

> **Definition**
>
> We call ***system*** the triplet (H, S, D) corresponding to a functional set, where H is a hardware, S is a software, and D some data.


> **Definition [<sup>w</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system)**
>
> The term ***hardware*** refers to machinery and equipment. In a modern information system, this category includes the computer itself and all of its support equipment. The support equipment includes input and output devices, storage devices and communications devices.

> **Definition [<sup>w</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system)**
>
> The term ***software*** refers to computer programs defined as the machine-readable instructions that direct the circuitry within the hardware parts of the system to function in ways that produce useful information from data.
>
> Thereafter, we will simply call ***program*** the set of machine-readable instructions of a given system. In other words, the program is the set of the modules of the software.

> **Definition [<sup>w</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system)**
>
> ***Data*** are facts that are used by systems to produce useful information. In modern information systems, data are generally stored in machine-readable form on disk until the computer needs them.

By nature, a system evolves over time as a result of the current processes running on it, and because of the eventual inputs received from out of the system.

> **Definition**
>
> A ***process*** is a triplet `(S, l, p)` where `l` is the instruction currently executed by a processor `p` in a given system `S`.


> **Definition**
>
> The ***state of the system*** `S` is the couple `(D, P)` where `D` represents the data of the system and `P` the set of processes running at a time `t`.


> **Definition**
>
> The ***behavior of a system*** is a description of a modification of its state during the execution of a given process.
