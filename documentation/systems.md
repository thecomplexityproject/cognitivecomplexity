## System


##### -> Hardware
> **Definition**
>
> The term ***hardware*** refers to machinery and equipment. It includes the computer itself and all of its support equipment. The support equipment includes input and output devices, storage devices and communications devices.

##### -> File
> **Definition**
>
> A ***file*** is a document containing machine-readable instructions, recorded in some part of a hardware.

##### -> Module
> **Definition**
>
> The set of machine-readable instructions of a file is called a ***module***.

##### -> Software
> **Definition**
>
> A ***software*** is a set of files that direct the circuitry within the hardware parts in the aim to provide some features to the users.

##### -> Program
> **Definition**
>
> A ***program*** is the set of the modules of a given software.

**Remark**

In terms of functionalities, we can also say that the aim of a software is to provide a set of features to the users. 

##### -> System
> **Definition**
>
> We call ***system*** the triplet (H, S, P) where H is a hardware and S a software which should provide the features of a product P.

##### -> Data
> **Definition**
>
> ***data*** are facts that are used by a system to produce useful information.

By nature, a system evolves over time as a result of the current processes running on it, and because of the eventual inputs received from out of the system.

##### -> Process
> **Definition**
>
> A ***process*** of a program `P` is a couple `(i, p)` where `i` is the machine-readable instruction of `P` currently executed by a processor `p`.

##### -> State of the system
> **Definition**
>
> The ***state of a system*** `S` is the couple `(D, P)` where `D` represents the data of the system and `P` the set of processes running at a time `t`.

##### -> Behavior of the system
> **Definition**
>
> The ***behavior of a system*** is the evolution of its state during the execution of a given process.

**Remarks**

* *system* and *hardware* are in the *world of measurability*, *i.e.* are referring to objects located in the real world.
* *software*, *data*, *process*, *state of the system*, *behavior of a system* are in the *world of the computability*, *i.e.* are referring to theoretical objects.

## Stack

##### -> Software component
> **Definition**
>
> A ***software component*** is a part of a software intended to be embedded in other softwares.

##### -> Framework
> **Definition**
>
> A ***framework*** is a set of software components developed in the aim to provide generic functionalities which may be used by the developers to create some software.

##### -> Stack
> **Definition**
>
> A ***stack*** is a set of frameworks and programming languages.

##### -> Stack of a code snippet
> **Definition**
>
> A ***stack of a code snippet*** `s` is the stack necessary to the correct operation of `s`.
