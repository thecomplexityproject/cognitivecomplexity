# Documentation

## Thematics

This documentation is organized by thematics :

* [The definition of Cognitive Complexity](#the-definition-of-cognitive-complexitycognitive-complexitymd)
* [The set of code snippets](#the-set-of-code-snippetscode-snippets-tmpmd)
* [The notion of *understanding*](#the-notion-of-understandingunderstandingmd)
* [The bugs](#the-bugsbugsmd)
* [The mean developer](#the-mean-developermean-developermd)
* [The systems](#features-and-systemssystemsmd)
* [The experimental protocols](#the-experimental-protocolsexperimental-protocolsmd)

## Propositions and conjectures

Some results ensue directly from the definitions of the different concepts described in this documentation and don't need experiments in the real world. We call them ***propositions***.

Other results are probably true, but must be calculated or measured in the real world. These results need the help of experimental studies to demonstrate their validity. We call them ***conjectures***.
