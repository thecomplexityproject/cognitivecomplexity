# Documentation

## Thematics

This documentation is organized by thematics :

* [The definition of Cognitive Complexity](#the-definition-of-cognitive-complexity)
* [The set of code snippets](#the-set-of-code-snippets)
* [The notion of *understanding*](#the-notion-of-understanding)
* [The mean developer](#the-mean-developer)
* [The systems](#the-systems)
* [The experimental protocols](#the-experimental-protocols)

## Propositions and conjectures

Some results ensue directly from the definitions of the different concepts described in this documentation and don't need experiments in the real world. We call them ***propositions***.

Other results are probably true, but must be calculated or measured in the real world. These results need the help of experimental studies to demonstrate their validity. We call them ***conjectures***.
