# Cognitive Complexity


> **Definition**
> 
> The ***cognitive complexity*** of a code snippet is the time required by a developer to understand it.

This definition is simple to understand and clarifies what we should measure: a duration. However, this definition has some ambiguities:

* What is a *code snippet* ?
* How to define a *developer* ?
* What do we mean by *understand* ?

These questions are studied in specific pages :

* [The set of code snippets](./code-snippets.md)
* [The mean developer]
* [The understanding]

With the help of these clarified concepts, we will be able to define experimental protocols which could be enough consensual to be used by the entire scientific community in the aim to collect comparable data.

* [Experimental protocols]
