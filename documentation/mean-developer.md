# Mean developer

## Definition

The definition of the [cognitive complexity](./cognitive-complexity.md) uses the term `mean developer`. We need to accurate what is exactly a `mean developer` to be able to calculate objectively the cognitive complexity of a given code snippet. In other words, we need to precise what are the characteristics of a developer which are correlated to the notion of cognitive complexity.

> **Definition**

> A ***developer*** is defined by a couple `(H, S)` where `H` represents a human being and `S` the set of skills correlated to the cognitive complexity.
